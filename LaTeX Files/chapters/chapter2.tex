\chapter{Analysis and Initial Experiments}

    % 2.1 Simulation Setup
    \section{Simulation Setup}
    Describe the setup and configuration of the Gazebo simulation.

    \subsection{IRIS Model Modifications}
    Detail any modifications made to the IRIS quadrotor model in Gazebo, such as motor adjustments.

    \subsection{Sensor Configurations}
    Specify sensor setups for motor failure detection and control feedback.

    \subsection{Motor Failure Setup}
    Explain how motor failure was simulated, including which motor was chosen for failure and at what time during the simulation the failure was introduced.

    % 2.2 Preliminary Results
    \section{Preliminary Results}
    \subsection{Initial Experiments}
    Present results from initial simulation runs, motor failure detection trials, and early control adjustments.

    \subsection{Data and Observations}
    Insert any relevant tables, plots, or images here.

    % 2.3 Observations and Adjustments
    \section{Observations and Adjustments}
    Discuss any issues encountered, refinements made to the control algorithm, and performance metrics observed (e.g., stability metrics, response times).
